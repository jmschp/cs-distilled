## Logic

It is important to learn formal logic and use it knowingly to solve problems.

### Operators

> In mathematical logic, variables and operators represent the validity of things. They don’t express numbers, but True / False values.

- Conditional operator: $→$

The conditional operator represents dependency between variables. $A → B$ this means that if $A = True$ then $B = True$. $B$ is dependent on $A$

- Negation operator: $!$

$!A$ is the opposite of $A$

- Biconditional operator: $↔$

$A → B$ doesn’t mean that $B → A$. To represent a bidirectional condition we should use the Biconditional operator: $A ↔ B$

- And operator: AND

With the AND operator for a condition to be evaluated to true, all expressions must be true.

- Or operator: OR

With the OR operator for a condition to be evaluated to true, at least one expressions must be true.

- Xor operator: XOR

The XOR operator expresses ideas that are opposite truths.

#### Examples

Expression: _if it is a sunny day, I’ll go for a walk_

The validity of the expression is based on the validity of two things, which can be mapped to logical variables $A$ and $B$:

- Variable **$A$: Sunny day**
- Variable **$B$: I walk**

So $A → B$ meaning that if $A = True$, the day is sunny, then $B = True$, I will go for a walk.

Every conditional expression has a contrapositive equivalent. If, I didn't went for a walk then the day was not sunny, because a sunny day forces a walk.

So for $A → B$ there a contapositive equivalent $!B → !A$.

Although, if I went for a walk it doen not necessarily means that the day was sunny. This condition says nothing about rainy days. So $A → B$ does not mean $B → A$.

|  A  |  B  |     | !A  | A → B | A ↔ B | A AND B | A OR B | A XOR B |
| :-: | :-: | --- | :-: | :---: | :---: | :-----: | :----: | :-----: |

### Boolean Algebra

> As elementary algebra simplifies numerical expressions, boolean algebra 5 simplifies logical expressions.

Exercise:

**Hot Server**: A server crashes if it’s overheating while the air conditioning is off. It also crashes if it’s overheating and its chassis cooler fails. In which conditions does the server work?

Mapping variables:

- $A$: Server overheating
- $B$: Air conditioning off
- $C$: Cooler fails
- $D$: Server crashes

Condition for the server to crash:

($A$ AND $B$) OR ($A$ AND $C$) $→ D$
$<=>$
$A$ AND ($B$ OR $C$) $→ D$

The server works when $!D$.

$!D →$ $!A$ AND ($!B$ OR $!C$)

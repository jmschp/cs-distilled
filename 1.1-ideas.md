# Basics

## Ideas

When performing some task, like modeling an algorithm, is always a good idea to dump all information on a piece of paper. This is a first step in organize the ideas. There are several ways to do it.

- Flowcharts
- Pseudocode
- Mathematical models

### Flowcharts

Computer code is mostly a process, and process can be described using flowcharts. To draw flowcharts follow [UML (Unified Modeling Language) guidelines](https://code.energy/uml)

> A specification defining a graphical language for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of distributed object systems.

Summarizing guidelines for flowcharts:

> - Write states and instruction steps inside rectangles.
> - Write decision steps, where the process may go different ways, inside diamonds.
> - Never mix an instruction step with a decision step.
> - Connect sequential steps with arrows.
> - Mark the start and end of the process.

### Pseudocode

Pseudocode is another way to describe an algorithm. It is human-friendly code, that does not take into account the syntax of a real programming language, we can even use spoken language.

Following, we could

```pseudocode
function check_if_student_qualifies(grade)
  if grade >= 80
    return true
  else
    return false
```

### Mathematical models

Mathematical models allow us to better understand a problem and reason with it.

Using a quadratic equation to solve the following problem.

> Livestock Fence  Your farm has two types of livestock. You have 100 units of barbed wire to make a rectangular fence for the animals, with a straight division for separating them. How do you frame the fence in order to maximize the pasture’s area?

$A = w \times l$

We can pick `w` and `l` that maximize `A`.

$100 = 2w + 3l <=> l = \frac{100}{3} - \frac{2w}{3}$

$A = w \times (\frac{100}{3} - \frac{2w}{3}) <=>$

A = 100w / 3 - 2w

w = 100 / 2 -3l / 2

$ax² + bx + c = 0$
$ax² + bx + 100 = 0$
